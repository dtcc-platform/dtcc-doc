# Installation

## Requirements

DTCC Doc requires Node.js which can be installed by

    brew install node   # on Mac
	apt install nodejs  # on Ubuntu

## Initial setup

The contents of the website reside in the `website` directory.
This directory was initially created by the command

    npx create-docusaurus@latest website classic

This is a one-time procedure that does not need to be repeated; the
generated contents of the `website` are part of the Git repository of
DTCC Doc.
